DLL Loader in C++ for Windows
==============

Intro
--------------
I wrote this project back in 2011 when I was playing a bit with DLL Injections.

There are 4 files in this project
- CDLL_Loader.cpp
- CDLL_Loader.h
- String_Conversion.cpp
- String_Conversion.h

CDLL_Loader has methods to Load and Eject DLL from running process.
String Conversion is used to convert byte to string.
